This is basicaly a web app which is one of the most easiest projects and is done by all newbies when they start learning either js or react or angular etc... My app takes in input from button and run the function when clicked on it. And using the power of DOm i am rendering the button count in the paragraph
Also Do Note that the styles are given by the mentor of iNeuron and was given to me as a challenge to not alter HTML nor CSS
